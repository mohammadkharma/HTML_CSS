          <h1>Stamina</h1>
          <p>The long hours of training by elite athletes makes them more susceptible to upper respiratory tract
            infections. This can be attributed to the effects of strenuous exercise inducing a degree of
            immunosuppression. Our programmes aim at re-balancing the HPA axis which results in less sickness during
            training and competition season.</p>

          <h1>Recovery</h1>
          <p>Plastics and pesticides interact with ATP generation, the mitochondrial respiratory chain and DNA
            regulation. Other pollutants can reduce antioxidants such as glutathione lowering the recovery rate of
            athletes. Our detox programme aims to enhance detoxification via biohacking of several systems.</p>

          <h1>Performance</h1>
          <p>As more elite athletes suffer from psychological and gastrointestinal conditions that can be linked to the
            gut, there is a need for targeting the microbiota therapeutically with the correct prebiotics and
            probiotics. Our digestive programmes rebalance the microbiome to enhance mood, immune balance and digestion
            for maximising nutrient uptake.</p>
